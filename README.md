# Geometry-Calculator
Design a Geometry class (Geometry.java) with the following methods:
A static method that accepts the  of a circle and returns the  of the circle.
Use the following formula: 
Use Math.PI for  and the radius of the circle for .
A static method that accepts the  and  of a rectangle and returns the  of the rectangle. Use the following formula: 
A static method that accepts the length of a triangle’s  and the triangle’s .
The method should return the area of the triangle. Use the following formula:

The methods should display an error message if negative values are used for the circle’s radius, the rectangle’s length or width, or the triangle’s base or height. 
B)	Write a program (GeometryTest.java) to test the class, which displays the following menu and responds to the user’s selection:
Geometry Calculator
1. Calculate the Area of a Circle
2. Calculate the Area of a Rectangle
3. Calculate the Area of a Triangle
4. Quit

Enter your choice (1-4):
Display an error message if the user enters a number outside the range of 1 through 4 when selecting an item from the menu. You are welcome to get user input for items #1-3 if desired, or you can use pre-set values to test. Display the calculated values returned from Geometry.java.
